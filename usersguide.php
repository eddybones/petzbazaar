<h1>Petz Bazaar v1.2</h1> <br>


Welcome to the Petz Bazaar! Users begin with 25 coinz and 0 quartz. The daily log in bonus awards 5 coinz. <br><br>
~Grand Tour~<br><br>
<div align=left>
My Shop - <br>
~ Set up your very own shop! Users start with 10 shop slots and earn more as they sell items in the marketplace. <br><br>

Account - <br>
~ You may open or close your shop at any time. Your shop closes automatically if you have not logged in for 30 days. Closing up will not delete your listings, it simply hides them and removes your link from the marketplace. Close up - fill your shop slots, and open back up to present all of your listings at once! 
<br><br>
~ State your rules and do basic shop customization with HTML. A custom CSS field is also available for experienced users who want to totally redecorate their page with new styles and colors. Please note that you must use valid CSS that is written to properly override the existing CSS styles. Thor has created this <a href ="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1o5ySLxuemw5svyJSD0ezUPakrG2aHZkdAqklAnj9g7w/edit" target="_blank"> handy guide</a> if you need assistance!
<br><br>
~ A "mute" feature is available under "additional settings." Adding users to your mute list will hide your shop from them and their shop from you. It will also prevent messaging and filter claw machine donations. Please note that if you mute a user, they are still able to view and purchase items that you donate to the boutique.
<br><br>
~ The currency transfer feature allows you to transfer coinz or quartz to other Bazaar users. 
<br>
<br>

Messages -<br>
~ Transactions are sent via the messaging system. You may also send messages to other users. Messages are deleted automatically after 30 days - so be sure to download your purchases!
<br> <br>

Marketplace - <br> 
~ Open shops with stock for sale are listed here, and shops with new listings since your last visit will have a star next to them.
<br><br>
Boutique -<br> 
~ Purchase special items with quartz currency at the Boutique! (Learn more about making a donation <a href ="boutique_donation_info.php"> here</a>)
<br><br>
Town Square - <br>
~ Play games to win quartz and coinz, and try out the claw machine in the Town Square! New games and activities, including special events, will pop up here.
<br><br>
</div>

~Additional Information~<br><br>
<div align=left>
Sales: items purchased from you in the marketplace. Earn a new shop slot for every 10 sales in your shop.<br><br>
Transactions: items purchased from you OR items that you buy in the marketplace with coinz. (Minigames that cost coinz to play do not count as transactions.) Earn 1 quartz for every 10 completed transactions in your shop.<br><br><br>

</div>

~Rules and FYI~<br><br>
<div align=left>
Donations to the Boutique and claw machine are final. Please keep this in mind before donating!<br><br>

Users may only have one account. Creating multiple accounts is a bannable offense, so if you ever have trouble accessing your existing account, please reach out to me to get it resolved.<br><br>

Please utilize the currency transfer option for all currency transfers instead of creating targeted sales in your shop. Coordinating empty sales with other users to generate quartz (quartz farming) is not allowed. Abuse of the transaction generated quartz system will result in accounts being disabled and/or the removal of the quartz transaction feature. <br><br>

Please be kind and respectful to one another and honor the adoption rules listed in users' shops. Users who are unkind, break rules, or deliberately take advantage of exploits will be banned. <br><br>

Please keep custom HTML and CSS additions, as well as any other content posted in your shop, appropriate for all ages and aligned with Petz Community values. Content that is malicious, inflammatory, divisive, or NSFW will not be tolerated.<br><br>

If you wish to purchase an item in the marketplace for another member of the Petz Community as a gift, contact the shop owner first to make sure they are alright with the pet changing hands a second time and with the final recipient. Please respect the shop owner's decision regarding the gifting of petz, as this is a part of honoring shop rules. 
Items purchased in the boutique are not for gifting unless otherwise stated in the item description (Holiday and event items may be intended for gifting purposes).<br><br>

You may contact me with questions, bug reports, suggestions, and account assistance. Please only contact me about an issue with another user if there is misconduct ocurring on the Petz Bazaar that is against the rules of the site and impactful to everyone's experience. <br><br>

I want this to be a happy place where folks get along, enjoy themselves, and feel comfortable participating. Let's focus on the love of petz that brings us together and HAVE FUN!<br><br>

Thank you for your support!<br>
