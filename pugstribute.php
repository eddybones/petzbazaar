<p>Operated by Midnightwolf, PUGS (Petz Universal Game Site), was a community staple for many years. 
Users enjoyed games, crafting their own pugscene in the neighborhood, showing their petz, and of course trading in the marketplace.
A number of community members assisted with PUGS - offering ideas, moral support, administrative assistance, and more. The site was a community effort 
and an engaging place for petz fans to gather for special sales events, mine for gems, and browse for their new best friend.

<br><br>

PUGS was something very special to the community, and while it cannot be replaced, it is my hope that The Petz Bazaar will preserve some of the 
creativity and allow similar experiences to be enjoyed by petz users, new and old. The Petz Bazaar features a special gem shop, the claw machine, digging for treasures,
and other activites from PUGS, which have been recreated and adapted with the most respectful of intentions. I hope that these features will feel like a pleasant echo of 
PUGS memories, as they are meant to salute classic, fan favorites and keep them from being forgotten or lost to time.

<br><br>

Plans for the Petz Bazaar include new and different features as well. It will take time for these plans to come to fruition, but it is my 
sincere hope to create a place that pays homage to the past while still moving forward with new ideas and offerings for the community. 

<br><br>

Thank you for being here!

Buck@Medusa fondly remembers some of the fun events that happened on PUGS:<br>
The Tree Event: This was a Christmas event where you could collect candy canes by playing mini games and then turn them in for a present under the tree. You could either keep the gift if you liked it, or re-wrap it for someone else to unwrap. Everyone got to keep opening gifts until they were all gone, and there were a lot!
<br><br>

Murder Mystery: There was a big murder mystery event that Midnightwolf wrote and put on himself, a whodunnit type game where you had to gather clues and figure out who the guilty party was.
<br><br>
The Lil Haunt: for a few years during the month of October I transformed my PUGS shop into The Lil Haunt, a pop up spirit Halloween shop where people could buy clothes, toyz, textures, spooky breddies and hexies. All of the proceeds were donated to the donation lottery!
<br><br><br>
Bunni@Funfetti reminisced with me about the big "live drops" that Neb@PoppyHill would host as fun events for folks with a quick click and points to spend! She also recalled saving up gems from mining to buy the cute gemstone stamps that Alex made! 
<br>
<br>
<br>

The "Treat Can" game allowed users to guess the number of treats in the can once per day. The winning number would be a random value between 1 and 100.
Shortbread@Canis Major recalls times when guessing the correct number for the treat can game came down to a final few numbers!
